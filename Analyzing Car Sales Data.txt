Project/Exercise: Analyzing Car Sales Data

You have been given a dataset containing information about car sales. The data is stored in a CSV file called car_sales.csv. The file contains the following columns:

Make: the make of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Ford, etc.)
Model: the model of the car (e.g., Corolla, Civic, Focus, etc.)
Year: the year the car was manufactured (e.g., 2018, 2019, 2020, etc.)
Price: the price of the car in dollars
Mileage: the number of miles on the car's odometer
Color: the color of the car
Location: the city where the car is currently located
Your task is to use Pandas to read in the car_sales.csv file, create a DataFrame from it, and then perform some basic analysis on the data. Specifically, you should:

Read in the car_sales.csv file using Pandas' read_csv function and create a DataFrame from it.
Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to get a sense of what the data looks like.
Determine how many cars are in the dataset.
Calculate the average price of a car in the dataset.
Determine the most common car make and model in the dataset.
Create a new DataFrame that only contains cars made in the year 2021.
Calculate the total mileage of all the cars in the dataset.
Determine the average price of a car with less than 50,000 miles on it.
Create a new column in the DataFrame that indicates whether a car is "expensive" or "cheap", based on whether its price is above or below the average price of all cars in the dataset.
Write the modified DataFrame to a new CSV file called car_sales_modified.csv.
